                            <p><ins>Your Assumption of Risk</ins><br>
                                Not all of the activities, exercises and other recommendations discussed on the Website, through the Service or communicated by Canyon Ranch @Home representatives are suitable for everyone.  When you participate in any specific exercise or exercise program, there is the possibility that you will be seriously injured or even die.  Accordingly, you must use your own judgment while using the Service. If you feel discomfort or pain, stop immediately and consult with a medical professional.  If you experience any potential or actual allergic reaction to a food or supplement suggested by your nutrition coach and/or described in any Materials on the Website, or you experience any adverse reaction to any changes in your caloric intake, consult with your physician immediately.  In the case of an emergency, dial 911.</p>
                            <p>YOU HEREBY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE SERVICE, AS WELL AS IN ANY SPECIFIC ACTIVITY OR EXERCISE RECOMMENDED TO YOU BY CANYON RANCH @HOME, IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY AND AT YOUR OWN RISK.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE AND WILL USE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT AT ALL TIMES DURING YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER ANY PARTICULAR EXERCISE, ACTIVITY OR OTHER RECOMMENDATION IS RIGHT FOR YOU.</p>
                            <p><ins>Your Service Team</ins><br>
                                When you register to use the Service, subject to these Terms, you will be assigned to a life management coach, who will work with you to help you set goals and provide support and motivation,  and you will also have access to a team of nutrition coaches and fitness coaches.  These program coaches will participate in online videoconference sessions with you as outlined below.  They will not, however, provide you with any medical diagnostic or therapeutic advice.  These program coaches may be employees or independent contractors of Canyon Ranch @Home.</p>
                            <p><ins>Coaching Sessions and Scheduling</ins><br>
                                Subject to the continued payment of all fees, and your ongoing compliance with all Terms herein, you may schedule up to a total of 24 coaching sessions during the duration of the program.  These coaching sessions are divided up over the course of 6 one-month periods, beginning upon the date you register for the Service; each monthly period is described herein as a “Program Month.”  For example, if you register on October 15, your first Program Month would start on October 15 and end on November 14.   In each Program Month, you may schedule 3 core coaching sessions (“Core Sessions”) as follows: (a) one Core Session per Program Month with your assigned life management coach; (b) one Core Session per Program Month with a nutrition coach; and (c) one Core Session per Program Month with a fitness coach (for a total of 18 Core Sessions over the 6 Program Month period).  You may also schedule up to a total of 2 additional sessions (“Floater Sessions”) during any one Program Month, up to a total of 6 Floater Sessions within the duration of the program.  These Floater Sessions may be with your assigned life management coach, a nutrition coach or a fitness coach.  Once you have completed your 6 Floater Sessions, you are not entitled to schedule any additional Floater Sessions for the remainder of the program.</p>
                            <p>When you register for an account, you will receive an e-mail requiring you to activate and log in. You will receive a phone call from a health concierge to schedule an orientation session.  Your first three one-on-one coaching sessions will be scheduled during your orientation session.  Thereafter, you will schedule future one-on-one sessions with your coaches by calling the Health Concierge Desk (1-888-872-5533).  It is solely your responsibility to schedule, reschedule or cancel your coaching sessions each Program Month.  Coaching sessions not scheduled, rescheduled, canceled and/or utilized in accordance with these Terms are subject to being forfeited.  We highly recommend that you schedule your coaching sessions as early in your Program Month as possible to maximize the schedule availability of the coaches and to prevent forfeiting any of your 3 Core Sessions.  If not used, your Core Sessions cannot be carried forward to a subsequent Program Month.  For example, if you fail to schedule or reschedule or are unable to schedule or reschedule a Core Session with a nutrition coach prior to the end of any Program Month, that Core Session is forfeited; you may not carry it forward and have 2 Core Sessions with a nutrition coach during the next Program Month (in such case, however, you could utilize any remaining Floater Session to meet with a nutrition coach).  Similarly, if you fail to use any of your Floater Sessions during the first four Program Months, you will only be able to schedule or reschedule 2 Floater Sessions in Program Months five and six and would forfeit the other 2 Floater Sessions.</p>
                            <p>All coaching sessions are subject to the availability of the coaches. Although Canyon Ranch @Home will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your preferred days and times, Canyon Ranch @Home cannot guarantee that any particular day or time will be available when you request it. You are not guaranteed any particular day or time for any coaching session until you have scheduled it. In addition, although Canyon Ranch @Home will make reasonable attempts to accommodate your request for a session with a particular nutrition coach or fitness coach, you are not guaranteed to speak with the same nutrition coach or fitness coach each time. It is expected that your life management coach will remain consistent throughout the duration of the program. However, you further understand and agree that Canyon Ranch @Home may replace and/or substitute any of its personnel at any time without any advance notice to you and without your consent.</p>
                            <p>If you need to reschedule or cancel a coaching session, you must do so at least 24 hours advance and must reschedule to another date in the same Program Month to avoid forfeiting that session. If you miss a coaching session without having timely rescheduled it, or fail to reschedule a Core Session within the same Program Month, that session is forfeited and may not subsequently be used.</p>
                            <p>You cannot schedule a same-day session. Sessions must be scheduled or rescheduled at least 24 hours in advance.</p>
                            <p><ins>No Recording Sessions</ins><br>
                                You may not record or allow others to participate in, observe or listen to any of your coaching sessions. Likewise, Canyon Ranch @Home does not record your video coaching sessions, although the program coaches may take notes.</p>
                            <p><ins>System Requirements</ins><br>
                                In order to utilize all of the of the features of the Service, including but not limited to video-conferencing for your coaching sessions, your computer, computer browser and Internet connection must meet our System Requirements listed on our System Requirements page, which can be accessed by clicking <a href="systemrequirements.html">here</a>.</p>
                            <p><ins>Video-Conferencing/Telephone Conferencing</ins><br>
                                Each of your coaching sessions is intended to be conducted using the video-conferencing feature of the Service.  In the event Canyon Ranch @Home experiences technical difficulties with or other unavailability of the video-conferencing feature, the session may be conducted alternatively by telephonic conference. If Canyon Ranch @Home is unable to conduct the session by telephonic conference, then Canyon Ranch @Home will reschedule your coaching session for another mutually agreeable time.  In such a case, the rescheduled session would not count as an additional session under the program.</p>
                            <p>Coaching sessions must start on time. If you are more than 10 minutes late to any coaching session, it will be marked as missed and you will not be able to reschedule it. If you still wish to meet with a coach, you may use a Floater session.</p>
                            <p><strong>5. FEES; RECURRING BILLING; NO REFUNDS; CANCELLATION; TAXES</strong></p>
                            <p>The Service is provided to you at the cost of $290 per Program Month (“Service Fee”) for six months (a total of $1,740), plus any applicable taxes.  At the time of registration, you are required to provide us with a valid, major credit card (“Registered Payment Method”), which will be charged automatically at the beginning of each Program Month.  The first month’s Service Fee will be charged to your credit card at the time of your registration.  The Service Fee for each subsequent Program Month will be charged automatically on the same day of the month until you have completed the program or have cancelled in accordance with these Terms.  For example, if you register on October 15, your credit card will be charged $290 (plus applicable taxes, if any) on that date for your first Program Month.  On November 15, your credit card will be charged $290 (plus applicable taxes, if any) for your second Program Month, and so on until you have paid the Service Fees (plus any applicable taxes) for each of the six Program Months.</p>
                            <p>You are responsible for paying, and will be charged for, each Program Month’s Service Fee whether or not you use your available coaching sessions during that Program Month. Except as otherwise expressly stated in these Terms, once charged to your Registered Payment Method, all Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>
                            <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you hereby authorize Canyon Ranch @Home to charge your Registered Payment Method for the amount of the monthly Service Fee (plus applicable taxes, if any) on the first day of each Program Month during the term of your Service until you have successfully made each of the six Service Fee payments or have cancelled your Service in accordance with these Terms.  You will receive an e-mail at the e-mail address you have provided to confirm your registration and payment of the first Service Fee.  You will not receive from Canyon Ranch @Home any e-mail, receipt or other notification of payment of the subsequent Service Fees.  Your only record of payment for these subsequent Service Fees will be the charge reflected on your billing statement for your Registered Method of Payment.</p>
                            <p>If, for any reason, your Service Fee payment is declined, reversed or otherwise is unsuccessful, Canyon Ranch @Home will notify you of the failure of payment by e-mail to the e-mail address you have provided to us.  You will have forty eight (48) hours from the time our e-mail is sent to bring your account current and to provide a new Registered Payment Method for payment of all future Service Fees.  If Canyon Ranch @Home does not receive your Service Fee payment within forty eight (48) hours of sending the e-mail notifying you of the failed payment, your right to use the Service will be cancelled automatically.</p>
                            <p>If you have questions about any charge, or if you believe there is an error regarding a charge, we have made to your Registered Payment Method, please call us as soon as possible (1-888-872-5533) or send an e-mail to healthconcierge@canyonranchathome.com. You are not liable for unauthorized charges, or for our failure to properly make or stop certain charges as required; however, you must notify us regarding the suspected problem or error no later than 60 days after the date of the charge for which you believe the problem or error appears. Your concern or question should include the following information:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Your name [and any other identifying information];</li>
                                <li>A description of the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and a clear explanation of why 		you believe it is an error or why you need more information; and</li>
                                <li>The dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>

                            <p>Within 10 business days after your call or our receipt of your written statement containing the information described above, we will attempt to determine whether an error has occurred and if it has, we will promptly correct the error. However, we may require up to 45 days to investigate the matter, and if we do, we will temporarily credit the disputed amount to your account within 10 business days so that you will have the use of the money or credit during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your concern or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account.</p>
                            <p>We will inform you of the results of our investigation within three (3) business days after completion. If we determine that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. In such a case, if we have previously temporarily credited your Registered Payment Method account for any disputed amount, we will initiate, and you hereby authorize us to initiate, a new charge to your Registered Payment Method account for the amount we previously credited.  If our investigation determines there was an error in the amount you were charged, we will promptly credit the appropriate dollar amount to your Registered Payment Method account, if we have not previously done so. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>
