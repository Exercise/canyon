                            <p>The purpose of the Website and Service is to provide individualized remote weight loss coaching, with one-on-one consultations with Canyon Ranch @Home coaches, as well as information, recipes and tools to help you reach your weight loss goals.

                            <p>Upon registration for the Service, you will also be asked to provide answers to our health questionnaire.  This questionnaire seeks information about your general health and lifestyle, including the reasons why you are enrolling in the program, your exercise, weight and sleep patterns and goals, health concerns, medications, surgeries, medical treatments, pregnancies, allergies, alcohol and tobacco usage, eating habits, physical restrictions and ways you cope with stress.</p>
                            <p>When you register for an account, you will receive an e-mail requiring you to activate and log in. You will receive a phone call from a health concierge to schedule an orientation session.  Your first three one-on-one coaching sessions will be scheduled during your orientation session.  Thereafter, you will schedule future one-on-one sessions with your coaches by calling the Health Concierge Desk (1-888-872-5533).  In the course of your one-on-one sessions with a coach or any session or call with a health concierge, the coach or health concierge may make notes of information that you disclose and enter that information into our records about you.</p>

Submission of this data is optional and at your discretion.  We may also partner with one or more fitness tracker technology companies and, only if authorized by you, we may obtain your exercise, weight, calorie and nutrition information, and sleep data that is recorded and uploaded from your fitness tracker device. This information will be made available to your coaches and health concierges. You will see some of this data displayed in the ‘My Tracker’ tab. Your coaches will be able to see additional data provided by your synced fitness tracker device.</p>
                            <p>You may also make notes and journal entries in the My Journal function of the Website.  The My Journal function is also an optional feature, and only you will have access to this data through the Website. The data will be accessible only to you, not to your coaches or health concierges.</p>
                            <p>You may submit personal information when communicating with a health concierge, which information may vary and is, of course, controlled by what you choose to share and disclose.</p>

                            <p>Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from you when you visit the Website. This information may include some or all of the following items: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, including the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using and the IP address of your Internet Service Provider; the type and version of Internet browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site, the length of your stay and the specific pages, images, video or forms that you access while visiting the site; the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, and if applicable, the search engine that referred you and any search strings or phrases that you entered into the search engine to find this site; and demographic information concerning the country of origin of your computer and the language(s) used by it.</p>
                            <p>We use this information to monitor the usage of our Website, assess its performance, ensure technological compatibility with your computer, and understand the relative importance of the information provided on our Website. We may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.</p>
                            <p><ins>Information Collected via Cookies</ins></p>
                            <p>“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by a web server. Cookies can be read by the web server in the domain that placed them on your computer.  The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites for authentication and to collect or track information about your activities while using the website.</p>
                            <p>Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the Website or most websites because browsers are often set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placements.</p>
                            <p>Cookies can be set to expire: (1) on a specified date; (2) after a specific period of time; (3) when a transaction has been completed; or (4) when a user turns off his/her Internet browser. A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie. Cookies that expire based on a time set by the Web server are called “persistent” cookies.</p>
                            <p>The Website uses “session cookies,” which are time bound and session bound. A cookie is placed when you first log in to the Website. The cookie has your name and a session token. The session token is destroyed after the session expires (i.e., after you have closed your Internet browser).</p>
                            <p>Users who allow cookies will see the login screen show their name  (“Welcome Back, Mary!”) the next time they log in.</p>
                            <p>We may use cookies for:</p>

                                <li>Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign in to the Website, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted session cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a persistent cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.</li>
                                <li>Storing Preferences and Settings. We may store your time zone, city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see relevant local information when you return to the Website. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.</li>
                                <li>Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.</li>

                            <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.  Instructions for blocking cookies in your browsers are available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.</p>
                            <p>Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Website and Service that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.</p>
                            <p>If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.  Instructions for deleting cookies in your browser are also available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.  If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p>
                            <p><ins>Google Analytics</ins></p>
                            <p>We use Google Analytics for analyzing the use of our Website. Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your computer to identify you as a unique user of this Website.  Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this Website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve this site and to gain a better understanding of our site visitors. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this Website, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Statement. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.  Website visitors that don’t want their visit data reported by Google Analytics can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.  For more information on the opt-out browser add-on, see the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-Out Webpage</a>.</p>
                            <p>In addition to Website analysis, we may use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.  When someone visits a website that has partnered with the Google Display Network, Google stores a cookie to remember their visits. This number uniquely identifies a web browser on a specific computer, not a specific person. Browsers may be associated with a demographic category, such as gender or age range, based on the sites that were visited.  Google may also use the content of the page or website or the main topics and themes from the page as well as data from third-party companies to associate interests with a browser’s anonymous cookie, taking into account how often people visit sites of those categories, among other factors.  Google may use information that people provide to these partner websites about their gender, age, and other demographic or interest information. Google may use the websites people visit and third-party data to infer this information. For example, if the sites a person visits have a majority of female visitors (based on aggregated survey data on site visitation), we may associate the person's cookie with the female demographic category.
