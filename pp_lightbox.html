<p class="cParagraph">Automatically Collected Information</p>
 
<p class="cParagraph">Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from you when you visit the Website. This information may include some or all of the following items: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, including the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using and the IP address of your Internet Service Provider; the type and version of Internet browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site, the length of your stay and the specific pages, images, video or forms that you access while visiting the site; the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, and if applicable, the search engine that referred you and any search strings or phrases that you entered into the search engine to find this site; and demographic information concerning the country of origin of your computer and the language(s) used by it.</p>
 
<p class="cParagraph">We use this information to monitor the usage of our Website, assess its performance, ensure technological compatibility with your computer, and understand the relative importance of the information provided on our Website. We may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.</p>
 
<p class="cParagraph">Information Collected via Cookies</p>
 
<p class="cParagraph">“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by a web server. Cookies can be read by the web server in the domain that placed them on your computer.  The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites for authentication and to collect or track information about your activities while using the website. </p>
 
<p class="cParagraph">Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the Website or most websites because browsers are often set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placements. </p>

<p class="cParagraph">Cookies can be set to expire: (1) on a specified date; (2) after a specific period of time; (3) when a transaction has been completed; or (4) when a user turns off his/her Internet browser. A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie. Cookies that expire based on a time set by the Web server are called “persistent” cookies.</p>
 
<p class="cParagraph">The Website uses “session cookies”, which are time bound and session bound. A cookie is placed when you first log in to the Website. The cookie has your name and a session token. The session token is destroyed after the session expires (i.e, after you have closed your Internet browser). </p>

<p class="cParagraph">Users who allow cookies will see the login screen show their name  (“Welcome Back, Mary!”) the next time they log in. </p>

<p class="cParagraph">We may use cookies for:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p class="cParagraph">Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign in to the Website, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted session cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a persistent cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.</p></li>

	<li><p class="cParagraph">Storing Preferences and Settings. We may store your time zone, city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see relevant local information when you return to the Website. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.</p></li>

	<li><p class="cParagraph">Site Analytics. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="cParagraph">How to Control Cookies</p>

<p class="cParagraph">Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.  Instructions for blocking cookies in your browsers are available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.</p>

<p class="cParagraph">Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Website and Service that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.</p>

<p class="cParagraph">If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.  Instructions for deleting cookies in your browser are also available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.  If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p>

<p class="cParagraph">Google Analytics </p>

<p class="cParagraph">We use Google Analytics for analyzing the use of our Website. Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your computer to identify you as a unique user of this Website.  Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this Website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve this site and to gain a better understanding of our site visitors. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this Website, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Statement. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.  Website visitors that don’t want their visit data reported by Google Analytics can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.  For more information on the opt-out browser add-on, see the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-Out Webpage.</a></p>

<p class="cParagraph">In addition to Website analysis, we may use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.  When someone visits a website that has partnered with the Google Display Network, Google stores a cookie to remember their visits. This number uniquely identifies a web browser on a specific computer, not a specific person. Browsers may be associated with a demographic category, such as gender or age range, based on the sites that were visited.  Google may also use the content of the page or website or the main topics and themes from the page as well as data from third-party companies to associate interests with a browser’s anonymous cookie, taking into account how often people visit sites of those categories, among other factors.  Google may use information that people provide to these partner websites about their gender, age, and other demographic or interest information. Google may use the websites people visit and third-party data to infer this information. For example, if the sites a person visits have a majority of female visitors (based on aggregated survey data on site visitation), we may associate the person's cookie with the female demographic category.  When you visit our Website, Google shares with us this demographic and interest reporting data that is associated with your browser.</p>

<p class="cParagraph">We may also use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online.  This service allows third-party vendors, including Google, to show Canyon Ranch @Home ads on sites across the Internet.  Canyon Ranch @Home and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together, to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your visits to the Website.</p>

<p class="cParagraph">You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising using the opt-outs offered by Google.  You can access more information about these options by clicking here: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-Outs.</a></p>

<p class="cParagraph">We will not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with any User Information without your prior express consent.</p>

<p class="cParagraph">Internet Based Advertising and Do Not Track Technology</p>

<p class="cParagraph">Whether or not your browser sends a Do Not Track signal, this Website does not use third-party advertising companies to serve ads, nor do we collect information about your visits to this and other websites over time to obtain information about you.  For this reason, this Website ignores Do Not Track signals sent by your browser.</p>
