			<h3 class="cSubHeader">How do I contact a Health Concierge?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">Email us by clicking <b>CONTACT A HEALTH CONCIERGE</b> on your program dashboard, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
			<p class="cParagraph cSpace">You can also call us at <b>888-872-5533</b>. The Health Concierge Team is available 7 days a week, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm MST (no DST). All voicemails left after hours will be returned the next day.</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">When does my program begin and end?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">Your program began when you registered. It ends 6 months from that date. If you’re ever unsure of where you are in your program, feel free to contact our Health Concierge Team.</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">What else can the Health Concierge team help with?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">Besides scheduling/rescheduling your Coaching Sessions, Health Concierges can assist with:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Questions regarding use of your program dashboard</li>
					<li>Account questions/issues</li>
					<li>Technical concerns</li>
				</ul>
			
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">What do I do if I can’t make a scheduled Coaching Session?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">Simply contact the Health Concierge Team 24 hours in advance and arrange for the session to be rescheduled.</p>
			<p class="cParagraph cSpace">Remember: While Floater Coaching Sessions can be used at any time in the program (maximum 2/month), Core Coaching Sessions must be used in the month they are assigned to or they are forfeited.</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">What if I miss a session?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">We’re sorry, but missed sessions cannot be rescheduled.</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">My video Coaching Session starts in a few minutes. Why can’t I access the chat area?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">You can only access the video coaching area of your dashboard five minutes prior to your scheduled time, so please come back then. The ATTEND NOW button will appear on your dashboard when you are able to join—click it to begin!</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">I’m ready for my scheduled video session, but I don’t see or hear anyone/they can’t hear or see me. What do I do?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">Your coach may not have arrived yet. If the coach has arrived, check your computer:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Is your Internet connection working/strong?</li>
					<li>Are your speakers on/unmuted/activated?*</li>
					<li>Is your microphone on/unmuted/activated?*</li>
					<li>Is your webcam on/activated?*</li>
				</ul>
			<p class="cParagraph"><i>*Click the gear icon on the bottom left of your video coaching screen to select your devices.</i></p>
			<p class="cParagraph cSpace">If this doesn’t solve the issue, and you cannot resolve the problem with the coach, please email <a href="mailto:techsupport@canyonranchathome.com">techsupport@canyonranchathome.com</a> for assistance. Please be specific when describing the problem you’re experiencing.</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">I’m having such a great conversation with a coach! Can I extend my session?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">Unfortunately, we can’t extend your current session, but you can pick up right where you left off during your next consultation. You can also schedule a Floater Coaching Session for some extra help at another time.</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">Can I speak to the coaches in between my sessions?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">You may contact your Life Management Coach with quick questions via the phone number and email address provided to you whenever you’d like. Remember, though: Floater Coaching Sessions can be booked at any time and are the best way to get more in-depth assistance from any of our coaches!</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">How do I change the contact information or credit card associated with my account?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">Just click on MY ACCOUNT at the top of your dashboard and make your changes there.</p>
			<h3 class="cSubHeader">Can I cancel my program?</h3>
			<p class="cParagraph">Weight loss is a journey and our expert team recommends sticking with the program for the full 6 months to see the best results. However, you may cancel at any time.</p>
